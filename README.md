## What's going on here
I'm making small React web apps.<br><br>
## Two projects above that will run in any browser
* [worldPopulation.html](https://atom-box.github.io/sandReact/quickies/rWorldPopulation.html)
* [naiveLoremIpsumGenerator.html](https://atom-box.github.io/sandReact/quickies/quickies/rLoremIpsumGenerator.html)
<br><br>These run React from the browser.  Their React and Babel are enabled by CDN.<br>

## Three projects above that only run in NODE
* road 0
* road 1
* pluralsight<br><br>
These were made by modifying [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)<br>
They won't run live here until I go through the work of setting up their  PACKAGE / NPM / DEPENDENCIES environment thing.<br>

## For setting up react and learning the syntax I used:
* Book: "The Road to React" by Robin Wieruch
* Book: "Pragmatic Programmers: React for Real" by Ludovico Fischer , ed. Brian Hogan
* Course: Pluralsight's Samer Buna's course ["Getting Started"](https://jscomplete.com/playground/rgs1.6).
* The docs at [Reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
