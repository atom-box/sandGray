## What's going on here
I'm making small React web apps.
## Click to run
These aren't assignments or anything.  They were both made from scratch out of my imagination while I was trying out the syntax for React. Both have React and Babel that loads into your browser from a CDN. They will open if you click them:
* Exercise 1 is [Spelling Owl](https://atom-box.github.io/sandReact/quickies/rDismissableListItems.html)
* Exercise 2 is [WorldPopulation.html](https://atom-box.github.io/sandReact/quickies/rWorldPopulation.html)
## Create-react-app
Exercise 3 was assigned by my Coursera course.  This runs on a server from Create--React-App.  
* Here is [the code](https://github.com/atom-box/sandReact/tree/master/confusion/src/components) 
* Here is a screen capture ![screencapture of vadonuts menu](https://github.com/atom-box/sandReact/blob/master/confusion/vadonuts-demo.gif)
