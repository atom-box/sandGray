## What's going on here
I'm making small React web apps.<br><br>
## Current project
The folder _Confusion_ contains my current Coursera exercises for the University of Hong Kong course *Front-End Web Development with React*
## Two viewable exercises
These will open in a browser if you click them:
* [Spelling Owl](https://atom-box.github.io/sandReact/quickies/rDismissableListItems.html)
* [WorldPopulation.html](https://atom-box.github.io/sandReact/quickies/rWorldPopulation.html)
<br><br>These run React from the browser.  Their React and Babel are enabled by CDN.<br>

## Three more of my exercises
The following were made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  You can only view the code.
* road 0
* road 1
* pluralsight<br><br>
For these to run in public I need to deploy them at my Digital Ocean.  I'm not on that chapter of the book.  And I'm cautious because they are a security vulnerability to my server.<br>

## Invaluable:
* Book: "The Road to React" by Robin Wieruch
* Book: "Pragmatic Programmers: React for Real" by Ludovico Fischer , ed. Brian Hogan
* Course: Pluralsight's Samer Buna course ["Getting Started"](https://jscomplete.com/playground/rgs1.6).
* The docs at [Reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
