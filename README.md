## What's going on here
I'm making small React web apps.<br>Each directory above is a self-contained homework project
## Two projects above that will run in any browser
These need no special environment; they run completely in browser.
* quickies/rPairStar.html RUN
* quickies/rWorldPopulation.html RUN
They are self-contained.<br>
Each one is a HTML file;<br>
their React is enabled by CDN, as is Babel via CDN too.  <br>

## Three projects above that will only run in NODE
These were made by modifying [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* road 0
* road 1
* pluralsight
They won't run unless you go through all the work of setting up their whole PACKAGE / NPM / DEPENDENCIES environment thing.<br>
Once that is done, npm start allows [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view them in the browser.<br>
